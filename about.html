            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I taught high school mathematics for 5 years, where I developed high level skills in management, organization, and communication. As an inner city school teacher, I learned the importance of management, decision making, perseverance, and patience. After identifying the absence of a programming class at my previous job, I flew to Colorado for CSPd Week and was trained to teach a high school computer science class. Since then, my focus has been software programming and front-end development. I am a lifelong learner, I love being challenged, and I always have a goal in mind!
