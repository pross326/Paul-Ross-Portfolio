                  This website style guide describes various types of color schemes, fonts, and text styles. This was one of my favorite milestone projects in the Codecademy Front-end Development course. This project was used as a reference for flexbox, colors, font API's, and CSS hover and click properties.

              <p>After The Brother's Mancia landscaping company completed some great work in my yard, I decided to use pictures of my yard to give their website a new and improved look. I used css transitions and incorporated javascript to bring buttons to life and enhance user experience.</p>

              <p> As a former math teacher, I tutored students outside of school and gained a following through word of mouth. I created my own tutoring website using HTML5 and CSS to mitigate scheduling conflicts. I incorporated a Calendly API so that my clients are able to choose times slots that are convenient for them.  </p>

                Using python, django, HTML, CSS, and git, I was able to create a working web application. I learned about Django ORM and Querysets, dynamic data in templates, and django admin/forms. I practiced using the command line and working in a virtual environment. It was very interesting learning how to run a local server and even deploy my blog.

            <p>In Codecademy's Front End Developer course, I designed this website after being given unique specifications. By completing this project, I was able to practice using a combination of border-box and flexbox, along with overlaying text and images. This project allowed me to use various methods of styling to determine the benefits of each. </p>

            <p>I wrote a program to optimize a credit card validation process. I based the program off of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm#Description">Luhn alogirthm</a>, which uses a check digit and multiple test credentials to validate identification numbers. I created two different versions (<a href="https://replit.com/@pross326/CC-Validator#index.js">Version 1</a> and <a href="https://replit.com/@pross326/CC-Validator-V2#index.js">Version 2</a>) to experiment with different methods.</p>
